**Importing SQL Server Database**
1) Make copy of these two files in SQL Server data directory. 
Generally, the default location of the directory is "C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL12.MSSQLSERVER\MSSQL\DATA"
2) Importing Database to SQL Server Management Studio: In SQL Server Management Studio, we can find "Object Explorer" window. 
Under this window, we can find "Attach" option on right clicking the "Database" folder item. 
In the next step, we have to attach newly copied SQL Server database file (.mdf). The ".ldf" file will be linked automatically with the .mdf file.
